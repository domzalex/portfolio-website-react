          <p className="about-text">My name is Alex Domzalski and I am a full-stack web developer with focus on the MERN development stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js); however I am also versed with PHP and MySQL. Outside of development, I am a touring and session bassist. I take my influence from eastern pop, gospel, and R&B; though I am comfortable in any genre. Along with my music work, I am studying to become a licensed Falconer and hope to aid in the conservation of migratory birds of prey.</p>
