          <p className="about-text">My name is Alex Domzalski and I am a full-stack web developer with focus on the MERN development stack and a part of the engineering group for <a href="https://www.studioazure.io" target="_blank">studioazure.io</a> where I help with development sprints. Outside of development, I am a touring and session bassist and am studying to become a licensed falconer with hopes to aid in the conservation of migratory birds of prey.
