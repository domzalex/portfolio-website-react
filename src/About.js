          <p className="about-text">My name is Alex Domzalski and I am a full-stack web developer with focus on the MERN development stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I'm currently looking for work and am thrilled to hopefully join an amazing team. Outside of development, I am a touring and session bassist. I take my influence from eastern pop, gospel, and R&B; though I am comfortable playing just about anything. Along with my music work, I am studying to become a licensed Falconer and hope to aid in the conservation of migratory birds of prey.</p>
